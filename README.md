# File Metadata Microservice
This is a challenge from https://freecodecamp.org

## Objective:
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to **[this page](https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/)** and deploy it to Glitch.


Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit [This Page](https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects).

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

## User Story:
>1. I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.

>2. When I submit something, I will receive the file size in bytes within the JSON response.

### Note
For this Project, I tried to get a code more modular, clean and easy to understand.
